Project Overview:

Given text files of warehouse items and their product numbers, 
create six different hash functions, each with its own hash table, 
that calculates an item's hash value and stores the product number in 
the corresponding item pallet within the hash table.

Once the hash table is generated, determine which hash table creates 
the most balanced distribution of items across nine item pallets.
